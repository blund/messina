A autotune harmonizer effect, inspired by the effect on Bon Iver's "22, A Million"

This is a project built in CSound, based on [Victor Lazzarni's autotune effect](http://csound.1045644.n5.nabble.com/for-all-the-budding-popstars-out-there-td2799919.html). 
Rather than depending on hard coded intervals, as in Victor's original code, this version lets you harmonize with any note by playing with a midi-keyboard.

There is still a lot of fine tuning left to do as well as cleaning up some of Victor's code.
This project also includes two wrappers so it can be used in Ableton Live through Max For Live. Instructions for this will be added later.
